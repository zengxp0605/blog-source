- we are introduced to the narrator, a pilot, and his ideas about grown-ups    

Once when I was six years old I saw a [magnificent](#magnificent) picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the [primeval](#primeval) forest. It was a picture of a boa [constrictor](#constrictor) in the act of [swallowing](#swallow) an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without [chewing](#chew) it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for [digestion](#digestion)."    
I [pondered](#ponder) deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:

I showed my [masterpiece](#masterpiece) to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing [frightened](#frighten) them.    
But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"    
My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:   
 <!-- <p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0px; TEXT-ALIGN: center"><img src="/d/images/xiaowangzi/285607432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第二号作品">     -->

The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and [devote](#devote) myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been [disheartened](#dishearten) by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.   

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a [glance](#glance) I can [distinguish](#distinguish) China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.    
In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them [intimately](#intimately), close at hand. And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.    
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:    
"That is a hat."    

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.
