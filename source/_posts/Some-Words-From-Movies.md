```
    Can you pull in the Leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope?  
    Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?
    Will it keep begging you for mercy? Will it speak to you with gentle words?  
    Nothing on earth is its equal. It si king over all that are proud.  
        --- from <Leviathan> (电影 利维坦)
```

```    
    To see the world, things dangerous to come to.
    To see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and to feel. 
    That is the purpose of life.
        --- from (电影 白日梦想家)
