## Detail  
I ask the [indulgence](#indulgence) of the children who may read this book for [dedicating](#dedicating) it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs [cheering](#cheering) up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children-- although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:    
To Leon Werth    
when he was a little boy
